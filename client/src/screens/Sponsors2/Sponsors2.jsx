                    REBECA, short for REunion and Bengal Engineering College Annuals, is the annual cultural fest of
                    IIEST, Shibpur. From the classical Saptami night, to the BEings' night on Ashtami, from the soulful
                    Kolkata symphonies on Navami, to the endless Bollywood magic on the Dashami night, our vibrant fest
                    is nothing short of a second Durga Puja to us! Get ready as the 84th edition of REBECA is right
                    around the corner. BEings, Pujo asche!
